Quake Emblem 4 (kinda)
This Quake Mod takes some inspiration from the Fire Emblem series with its turn based combat mechanics and level system with random stat increases based on the class.

Turn Based Combat:
Whenever you attack and hit an enemy your "turn" ends and you are no longer able to move or shoot.
After your turn ends it is the enemies turn to attack you. Once they hit you you can now move and and the enemy will not be able to move or shoot.

Classes:
Classes are tied to keys and you can change them whenever. Classes change your growth rates for stats and stat multipliers.
Berserker - G - This class is focused on Health and Attack.
Sniper - H - This class is focused on Dex.
Armored Knight - J - This class is focused Defense.
Swordmaster - K - This class is focused on Speed.
Sorceror - L - This class is focused on Magic and Resistance.

Stats:
Health - Normal health stuff
Attack - Each attack stat increase damage by 1%
Magic - Each magic stat increases damage by 1% for Sorceror
Dex - Each dex stat increases crit chance by 1%
Speed - Each speed stat increases chance to avoid by 1%
Def & Res - Affects how much damage you take.
